QUESTION 1: 

Given the following dataset:

a = np.random.normal(loc=64, scale=2, size=500)
b = np.random.normal(loc=70, scale=2, size=100)

Write the appropriate to display multiple histogram on the same axis. The plots for both datasets show be fully
visible.
[Hint: Use the 'alpha' argument]

Import the data provided into your python environment and use it to answer the questions that follow.

QUESTION 2:
Using matplotlib module, make a lineplot of 'age' on the x-axis against 'children' on the y-axis using 
the following labels for your plot:
x-axis: 'Age (years)'
y-axis: 'Number of children'
plot title: 'Plot of Age against children'.

QUESTION 3:
How would you use matplotlib module to make two different subplots on different axes with the following 
characteristics?

a) First subplot: 
i. pie chart using the 'sex' column. Ensure the percentage on the pie chart is taken to 2 d.p.

b) Second subplot:
i. Create a bar-chart with the 'region' column. 
ii. Carefully label the chart with x-axis: 'Region'; y-axis: 'Counts'; title: 'Bar plot for Region'.

QUESTION 4:
Using matplotlib, plot two histograms on the same axis for columns 'age' and 'children'. Ensure the following
is indicated in the plot:
1. The two plots should be clearly visible to the eye [Hint: Use the 'alpha' argument]
ii. Use appropriate titles for the axes and the plot

QUESTION 5:

Using the dataset given below,

x_var = np.random.normal(loc = 40, scale = 1.5, size = 200)
y_var = np.random.normal(loc = 50, scale = 1.5, size = 300) 
z_var = np.random.normal(loc = 60, scale = 2, size = 300)

i. Create histograms for the two variables,x_var and y_var, on the same axis. Ensure the two plots can easily 
be see using the appropriate parameter. Also, use the legend() function for the plot.

ii. Make two subplots using the 3 variables as follows:

1. Make a lineplot of y_var against z_var for the first subplot
2. Make a histogram for the second subplot using x_var.
[Hint: All plots should be well labeled]
